I am a third-year Ph.D. advised by Prof. [Jishen Zhao](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/) in Computer Science and Engineering Department of UC San Diego, starting in 2022. I am now aiming to build efficient systems for machine learning. Before coming to UCSD, I received my B.E. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University.
I have a broad interest in combining machine learning and computer systems, with a special focus on the interaction between ML and System. I have previously focused on more acceleration for sparse computing (e.g. GNN, Pointcloud acceleration) and devoted myself to some open-source projects like [dgSPARSE](https://dgsparse.github.io/) and [CogDL](https://cogdl.ai/). Now I am working on agent framework that could help design better system, especially moving to MLsys self-evolution. Some topics that I have been working on are listed below:

- LLM Agent System for MLSys
- Machine Learning Compiler
- High-performance GPU Kernels
- Autonomous Software Engineering (SWEBench)

Feel free to contact me if you share any common interests.
